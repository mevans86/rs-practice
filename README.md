Tetrahedral carbons attached to four different ligands exist in one of two possible configurations. The *R*/*S* convention is used by organic chemists to distinguish between these two possible configurations in the names of organic compounds. This (currently incomplete) web application helps users practice *R*/*S* labeling in a timed environment. The overarching goal is to improve the user's ability to work with molecules mentally in three dimensions.
